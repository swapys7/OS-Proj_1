OS-Proj_1
=========

ยง1.1 Getting Started
-
*Here's what it looks like Project 1 will entail:*

1. Modify Base Kernel in threads/
2. Modify Timer implementation in devices/
3. Try tests in /tests

ยง1.2 Grading
-
*50% Test Results, 50% Design Quality*

Testing

1. To test everything, run `make src/threads/build/check`
2. To run a single test: `make src/tests/threads/TESTYOUWANT.result`

Design

1. In the end it may be more worth while to make sure the design document is perfect than to spend hours trying to pass that one last test.

2. Copy new or modified `struct`, `struct member`, `global`, `typedef`, `enumeration`, and `static` declarations into the design document, to highlight for us the actual changes to data structures. Identify each's purpose in less than 25 words.

3. Describe the `algorithms` that make the code work

4. Explain how you chose to synchronize this particular type of activity

5. Justify your design decisions, by comparing them to alternatives.

6. The `source code` itself must look good, especially parts that are most relevant to the issues focused on in the project.

7. Add comments to every definition of something

ยง1.3 Don't Cheat
-
1. You may use public libraries
 * E.g. public classes for queues, trees, etc.
2. You may look at the real Linux implementation (cite the source)

3. You may _not_ look at the code of someone else who completed this project
