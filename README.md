ยง2.2.2 Alarm Clock Description
--

The current version "_busy waits_", spinning in a loop, checking the current time, and calling thread_yield(); until time is up. *Reimplement it to avoid busy waiting*.

Things for Knowing of:
--

1. Unless the system is otherwise idle, the thread need not wake up after _exactly_ x ticks. It just needs to be put on the `ready queue` after the correct amount of time.


Current Ideas:
--

1. We need to implement a wait-queue list or some other kind of list

1. I think the idea is to use a sema_down(); to take the thread off the READY_LIST and put it on a list of threads waiting on a Semaphore by using the elem member of the struct thread.

1. Check out the /* Statistics. */ section of `thread.c`, it keeps track of `timer_ticks` and `thread_ticks`. I think that is important.

1. Do we use `wait() & signal();` in `devices/intq.c` "whose callers are responsible for reenabling interrupts" (ยง2.3.0 FAQ)?

1. Judging by the added lines to thread.h,  maybe that is where one adds the new WAITING_LIST.

1. Maybe the number of ticks is a condition_variable, as described in `synch.c`
    * but with that method, it seems like we would need a seperate lock/condition for each thread, which may be avoidable with semaphores, though maybe not

The Other Assignment in this Assignment:

ยง2.2.3 Priority Scheduling
--

1. Implement priority scheduling in Pintos.
    * Priorities range from 0 to 63, where higher is higher

1. Implement priority donation to deal with the issue of "priority inversion". Only for the locks, not the other constructs.

    * This is for the situation where H is waiting for a lock held by L, but L never gets to run

    * This must still work in cases of nested donation, up to 8 levels!:
        * H is waiting for M which is waiting for L, so H must levitate L to H, then M to H, then run.
    * H will donate to L with its lock, even if L is READY but not RUNNING

1. Implement the following two functions, for which only the skeletons have been provided in `threads/thread.c`.

    * Function: void thread_set_priority (int new_priority);
        1. Sets the current thread''s priority to new_priority.
        1. If the current thread no longer has the highest priority, yields.

    * Function: int thread_get_priority (void);
        1. Returns the current thread''s priority.
        1. In the presence of priority donation, returns the higher (donated); priority.

    * You need not provide any interface to allow a thread to directly modify other threads'' priorities.

Ideas:
--

The True-Priority should be one thing, and the Highest-Donated-Priority should be a completely different field.

Files/Lines they Modified to Make Reference solution:
==
 1. `devices/timer.c`       |   42 +++++-
    * Contains timer_sleep(); itself
    * Probably won''t need to modify anything else in it

 1. `threads/fixed-point.h` |  120 ++++++++++++++++++
    * I don''t see this file anywhere, maybe they made it !

 1. `threads/synch.c`       |   88 ++++++++++++-
    * semaphores, locks, condition variables

 1. `threads/thread.c`      |  196 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++----
    * Initializes lists, manipulates threads, calls main to start things out, does the scheduling

 1. `threads/thread.h`      |   23 +++
    * I think adding 23 lines to this means they added a couple methods to `thread.c` and had to declare them?

 * 5 files changed, 440 insertions(+); 29 deletions(-);


In General, What else Needs to Be Done:
==

The Design Doc
--

It is saved in the base directory, just like this file, it is called threads_design.txt

Follow the C Style Guide
--

1. Summarize major sections of code
1. Use meaningful variable names
1. Describe what function does, parameters, and return values
1. Don''t use extra whitespace inside brackets and braces
